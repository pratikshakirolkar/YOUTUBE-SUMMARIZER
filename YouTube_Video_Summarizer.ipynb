              "\"hello everybody in this video i'm going to show you guys a very simple and interesting website which is very useful in creating mockups now when i say mockups what kind of mockups let's say you have created a ui for an application and you want to show that application inside an actual mobile phone now if you go on google and search for a transparent png image of some mobile phone it's a very tedious task and you won't really get a high resolution image so this is where this website comes in play now this website has numerous mobile phones like iphone google pixel and whatnot it has tablets it has monitors it has tv screens and even smart watches if you have created the ui for the same so all you have to do is simply take your ui upload it on the website select the particular template and download the mock-up that's it so that was a rough idea about what the website is now let's get straight into the video where i can show you how the website actually operates so the name of the website is mockmagic.com as you can see the link to the website is in the description you can go right ahead now on the home page there is nothing much to read there's a basic introduction video which you don't obviously have to watch because you are watching how to use the website right so let's get straight to it you can either press get started or create a mock-up whatever works for you now first of all you will see a template of iphone 13 yes this is the template now i'll give you a basic idea here you can change the device okay there are devices we'll get to it here you can change the variant of the device basically its colors and stuff okay then you can change the orientation portrait or landscape whatever you want and finally select file you can select uh supported formats png or jpeg image whatever you want that you have created okay so let's get started first of all i'll select the file now i've created a ui for an android device so let's go with a device first so i'm gonna select samsung galaxy s20 android device and let's select the file now here i have a phone ui right here now this is the mock that i've created so i'll open it okay so this is the ui that i had designed now let's change the variant let's go with pink one or let's say graven okay then i can also change it to landscape but i have designed a portrait a vertical ui right so let's keep it this way and then i'll crop it now the crop feature is really great it allows you to align things you want them and you can also crop whatever you have created from here okay just apply it and leave it for now i'm going to leave it as it is and simply hit apply and we're done now the mock-up is ready now all you have to do is simply download the mock-up but if you simply press on download the file name will be untitled so to change the name of the file by default simply give name to the project up here on the top left okay so i'm gonna keep it ui a simple one okay so once i have kept the name simply i'll press download mockup and ui.png is downloaded if i open the file as you can see a png image of my ui design inside an actual ui mockup okay so that's it guys that's how you can operate the website here on the top left you have only one useful option that is empty canvas okay so i have emptied the canvas now i'll show you other devices and then we'll get done now phone is done let's go let's go ahead with an ipad here i'll add this image again i'll crop it i'll adjust the crop i'll hit apply and be good i can also change the variant yes and i can download the mockup then next device is let's go with the watch apple watch yeah i'll replace it with this image again crop adjust it apply and we're done select a particular color download the mock-up and here we have it the mock-up yeah orange color the image is there and it looks great let's go back to the website here we're done with watch now final few things a laptop here i'll replace it with this image that i've created this ui yeah looks great i can change the variant crop it if i want download it then you also have a tv which will basically look the same it won't really change now there's something wrong with this website for from the past few minutes it doesn't really load stuff i don't know why yeah it's it's here okay so for tv you have three variants withstand with studio stand or without stand you can use whichever you want and simply download the mock yeah so you can use all of the devices finally they have an imac pro yeah and they also have a apple pro display what was it xdr yeah so those were the mockups that they provide that's how you can use a website and that's basically how it operates so that was the website guys now a little announcement if you are looking for someone to design a ui for your website or application then you my friend are at luck because myself and my friend are a great team who design beautiful uis so if you are looking for someone who can
