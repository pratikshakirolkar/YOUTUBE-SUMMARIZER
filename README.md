# YOUTUBE-SUMMARIZER
Basically, the YouTube Video Summarizer project was created to fetch the summary from the video rather than waste lots of time watching the entire video. 
The transcript is fetched from the video and converted into a short summary. 
The summary is in the form of audio and text with multiple language options (Marathi, Hindi, and English). 
The entire code is based on the Python programming language and uses the Jupyter tool.
